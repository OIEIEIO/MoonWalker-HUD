# MW-HUD up! mode, tell the story

MoonWalker-Hud repo is a collection of Jupyter notebook code snippets/blocks/programs developed during the NASA and CSA Space Apps challenge. 

Time between Oct 1-2 2022

Efforts towards 2 challenges were made: 

1. Exploring the distant universe with James Webb Space Telescope | CSA |
2. Can AI Preserve OUR science LEGACY? | NASA |

#### The James Webb Space Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph.

One of Canada's contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope.

``` FGS - The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) ```

The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) is the most sophisticated guidance sensor of any telescope ever built. It locks on to bright stars in deep space to keep Webb's images sharp.

What does the Fine Guidance Sensor do?

1. Identifies and locks on to preselected guide stars
2. Tracks objects in our solar system with high precision
3. Keeps Webb's gaze perfectly aligned
4. The FGS consists of two identical cameras that are critical to Webb's ability to "see." The FGS can select a star from a catalogue of nearly one billion guide stars. These known cosmic reference points enable Webb to calculate its position in space.

# A watchful guide

The FGS remains active during all of Webb's observations. It provides Webb's stability system with extremely precise data 16 times per second.

The Canadian-made sensor is so sensitive that it can detect a tiny angular displacement equivalent to the thickness of a human hair as seen from one kilometre away. That's like spotting someone blink in Toronto, all the way from Montreal!

Although NIRISS is packaged with the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), the 2 instruments are functionally independent of each other.

The event was a first time experience and puts you in direct contact with some of the most interesting people on and off planet.

A variety of age groups, sincerely participating from all parts of the world.

Not withstanding the excitement and planning for some teams, others with a passion for SPACE also showed up with the intent to earn and learn their way to the next level.

The arena is set the night before and opens in a flurry of discord servers and channels. Hundreds of participants show up, maybe thousands, who knows? 

Arena: I mean wow, high school students, university student, proffesors, researches, inventors, dreamers, judges, mentors, project lead to help, SME. CSA, NASA, experts, novices, well the list goes on. 

I think all of us get involved for a variety of reasons and its just fantastic to see. Its a heady mix and very surreal.

``JugglerDad: A lot of people get involved just because they care – they have a passion for the moon and they have a desire to help make it happen and share the experience with others.

Awa: As I said earlier – to help!``

Teams are scrambling to get their footing in the competition, with some having to start from scratch due to no-shows or last minute dropouts. 

Day two has some serious traction when mates align and we begin to understand all the aspects of what each team participant and member brings to the table the needed skills which are the piece parts of success in the challenge. You do get to appreciate all of the volunteer support provided by many through their knowledge and expertise, and their goal is to continually make all information more easily accessible, to identify and educate via as many routes as possible. During the event organizers develop and improve educational resources and infrastructure as a group, in the form of mentorship and continual education 0as we develop and progress into the future.

I think all of us here today can attest to the fact that, we would not be here without the unwavering dedication, commitment and support from family, friends, and the entire organzing team.

IF there was more time during the challenge we may have been able to complete the code and have a fully functional MW-HUD see below and would like to see this develop as an education tool, portal.

! Education comes in many forms, and gaming is definitely one of the most popular and effective ways to learn these days. Let's see if we can come up with some ideas on how to gamify the MW-HUD interface to make it more engaging for users.

Take a glimpse at what the future holds for Spacewalkers.

MW-HUD is an AI learning interface
for future space walkers
currently helping visual data extracted from FGS and NIRISS sensors 
atm scanning through CSA public documents and NASA ntrs sti (space apps) documents
atm also perform task using NLP functions to extract human readable subject matter content 
using qualified human readable subject matter search strings processed through filters usable to a future moonwalker
but it can not count galaxies yet ...smiles
and since gaming is part of youth these days - could easily be gamified as an experience to inspire and engage
And that is what we are all here for today - to explore and discuss how we can gamify the experience to inspire youth - while they learn

MW-HUD is an AI learning interface

the idea : to inspire future space walkers with an AI assisted HUD

if you are going to be a space walker, you will likely need a helmet

We have a wonderful new invention to share with you.

MoonWalker Heads Up Display is a text and visual search tool for your helmet aka MW-HUD

A software addon to your HUD package. Runs on Jupyter notebook and can be used in a modern python runtime environment. Scalable to the AI and beyond.

Welcome to the instruction of how an AI assisted HUD is helping future moonwalkers visualize data extracted from FGS and NIRISS sensors. You can now also add deep eye knowledge search commands including access to scanning through CSA public documents and NASA ntrs sti (space apps) documents.

ex: MW-HUD up! access CSA deep eye network, search for a exoplanet Keppler22b, show me where is, display images from NIRISS, filter select, search for water... "98%" chance of water at this site"

Your HUD package can also perform task using NLP functions to extract human readable subject matter content using qualified human readable search strings processed through filters usable to a future moonwalker.

Since gaming is part of youth these days - could easily be gamified as an experience to inspire for the next generation of space walkers or to entertain folks of all ages.

What will your idea change? MW-HUD up! mode, dream space

Captivate your audience with what it could be? mode, stop, access CSA deep eye, show current FGS target, name of galaxy, search NIRISS images for galaxy ? run image filter protocol omega_003, thank you

What can your solution do for people, the world, and beyond? MW-HUD up! mode, dream space

Thankyou for a great weekend

if we had more time

fun, great, and special attempts were performed to create a video for the challenge presentaion given our short time

update - the story does not end here - stay tuned on the repo if intreseted - it will start to share some amazing images MW-HUD up!
