MW-HUD is an AI learning interface

if you are going to be a space walker, you will likely need a helmet

We have a wonderful new invention to share with you.
MoonWalker Heads Up Display is a text and visual search tool for your helmet aka MW-HUD

A software addon to your HUD package. Runs on Jupyter notebook and can be used in a modern python runtime environment. Scalable to the AI and beyond.



Welcome to the instruction of how an AI assisted HUD is helping future moonwalkers visualize data extracted from FGS and NIRISS sensors. You can now also add deep eye knowledge search commands including access to scanning through CSA public documents and NASA ntrs sti (space apps) documents.



ex: MW-HUD up! access CSA deep eye network, search for a exoplanet Keppler22b, show me where is, display images from NIRISS, filter select, search for water... "98%" chance of water at this site"



Your HUD package can also perform task using NLP functions to extract human readable subject matter content using qualified human readable search strings processed through filters usable to a future moonwalker.

Since gaming is part of youth these days - could easily be gamified as an experience to inspire for the next generation of space walkers or to entertain folks of all ages.
